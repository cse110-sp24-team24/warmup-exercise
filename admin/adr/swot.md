## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths

- We were able to focus on creating an intuitive, appealing user interface, following the philosophy of putting the user experience first.
- The simplicity of the app further adds to a smooth user experience and ensures good performance (since not a lot of extra code needs to be processed). Users can come to the app for the exact purpose of having a todo list and use it easily.
- Having short meetings after class was helpful in knowing everybody's progress and checking in to see if anybody had blockers as well as to know where we were in terms of progress for the assignment.

### Weaknesses

- The way we split up the tasks for the project led to some blockers between tasks, meaning not everyone could work on their task at the same time. In the future, we would like to be more mindful of how tasks are split.
- Since the project is completely rendered client-side, the program is open to security risks and attacks.
- Communications between sub teams can be improved as many depended on other sub team's progress. Leaders for each sub team can be added to assure there is a better flow of communication between each sub team.

### Opportunities

- We may be able to connect the app to a database such as MongoDB to store user information and tasks, allowing for persistant storage so users can access their todo lists anywhere, anytime.
- We can automate our version control processes by adding a CI/CD pipeline through Github Actions. In particular, we plan on using technologies such as ESLint to lint our code.
- We can add more ways to personalize the app so that the user can change things such as the background image and fonts.

### Threats

- Competing todo list apps may have added features (for example, connecting to Google Calendar) that may make them more appealing.
- Other todo list apps are accessible in many ways such as offline and via websites and mobile apps.
