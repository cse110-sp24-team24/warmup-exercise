# Task List Widget

## Overview:
Creating a Task List (or To-do list) widget which allows users to add weekly tasks, mark them completed, and remove them.

## Requirements:
* The widget must read in data from hardcoded JSON files.
* One should be able to add new tasks for a specific day.
* One should be able to mark and remove completed tasks.
* One should be able to use the widget using a keyboard (accessibility).
* One may have the ability to change background pictures.
* It could be used on a phone(flexibility).

## Specific components:
* Starter HTML, CSS, Javascript file
* Add task button + JSON stuff (split up adding button HTML, adding logic, JSON file logic)
* Remove task - clicking on a task should blur it out (blur out task, move to bottom, create button to delete all blurred out tasks)
* Rendering the tasks under different days on the HTML file (adding days with unordered lists below, creating dropdowns)
* Styling
